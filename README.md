# PCA9685 servo controller to control a L298N H-Bridge
With this set of python programs it is possible to use a PCA9685 servo controller board to control L298N H-Bridge. Due to the fact that the Raspberry Pi has problems to generate a clear PWM signal I will use the PCA9685 servo controller to generate the PWM signal for the L298N H-Bridge.
